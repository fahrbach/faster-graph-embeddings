# Faster Graph Embeddings via Coarsening

This repository contains the source code for the experiments in
[Faster Graph Embeddings via Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02817).

## Summary

We investigate how coarsening algorithms based on the Schur complement affect
the predictive performance of random walk-based graph embeddings for different
learning tasks.
Our multi-label vertex classification experiment builds on the framework for
[NetMF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02971) (Qiu et al., WSDM 2018)
and compares various one-vs-all logistic regression models.
Our link prediction experiment builds on the setup in
[node2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00653) (Grover and Leskovec, KDD 2016)
and explores the effect of vertex sparsification on AUC scores for several
popular link prediction baselines.
